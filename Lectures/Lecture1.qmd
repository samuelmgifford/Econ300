## Introduction - Who am I

-   Bachelor's in actuarial science, 2013
    -   Pricing actuary at Allstate until 2019
-   Software Engineer in financial risk management 2019-2020
-   4th year PhD student in economics
    -   Anticipated graduation next academic year
    -   Current research in networks among boards of governors
-   1150 ELO in Age of Empires 2
-   Married for 12 days

## Introduction - Who Are You?

-   This is a small class - I should learn all of your names quickly
-   Name, major, year
-   Something interesting about yourself (Optional, but recommended)
    -   Hobbies? Fun summer activities? Favorite math theorem?

## Introduction - What is Econometrics

## Introduction - What is Econometrics

-   Historically, measurement for economists
    -   Use data to construct supply/demand curves, elasticity, etc.
-   Current focus is causal analytics
    -   Used for policy analysis. Used by many fields!
-   Mechanically, this class is about interpreting linear regression
    -   And mostly about understanding its limitations
    
## Syllabus Review

-   Office hours after class. If these times don't work you can let me know and I should be able to accommodate most times.
-   Statistical software will be used in class and homework
-   Class participation via iclicker, and short weekly homework assignments
    -   These are intended to be easy points to keep you engaged
-   This class is harder than what you've probably had in the past. You'll need to pay attention in class to get an A/B
    -   But it's really not that hard if you actually try!

## What is Econometrics - a motivating example

-   What is the effect of college education on income?

-   Will getting a masters degree after graduating increase your earnings by \$13,000?

## Motivating Example, major choice

![](../img/salaryandgrebymajor.png){width="200%"}

-   Is the only difference the choice of major?

## Motivating Example (continued)

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
dt <- fread("../data/salarybymajor - Sheet1.csv")
ggplot(data=dt[,.(`Quantitative GRE Score`,`Starting Salary (2020)`)],aes(x=`Quantitative GRE Score`,y=`Starting Salary (2020)`)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() + geom_smooth(method="lm",se=F,linetype="dashed")
```

-   Engineering majors are very different from history majors before entering a program

## Introduction - What is Econometrics

-   What we want is the effect of college (or major) while holding all else constant ("Ceteris Paribus")
-   Normally we can achieve this by a randomized control trial
    -   Usually not practical or ethical
    -   e.g. randomly exposing people to wildfire smoke

## Introduction - What is Econometrics

-   Instead we make use of research designs that use "natural experiments"
    -   For schools: lotteries for charter school attendance
    -   For pollution: the direction that wind is blowing

## Introduction - What is Econometrics

-   Our workhorse model is ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
    -   We're just fitting a line to data
    -   The nuance lies in the interpretation
    -   Building block of more advanced machine learning and AI
